                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3 col s12">I'm a Frontend Software Engineer who strives to
                    build dynamic apps and websites with my natural talent for organization and love of utilizing
                    creative ideas. <img class="profImg" src="style/images/amanda.jpg" /> I love to organize projects
                    step by step, implementing tests and guidelines to avoid errors or minimize debugging issues, and
                    following through to completion with collaborative ideas. Experienced working collaboratively with 
                    team members within Engineering and outside of the Engineering department. Known among coworkers 
                    for: having an attention to detail, working well with everyone, and having a willingness to learn 
                    from others to produce and provide an excellent finished product.</p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3 col s12">I'm a creative with several different medias, a
                    TV/Movie afficianatto, and a video game player with a love for animals. I enjoy trying
                    new foods and traveling with friends when im not learning a new technology or craft to make
                    something new.</p>

                <h2 class="header">Background</h2>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">At a young age I had a great affinity for computers and
                    video games, which evolved into building basic guild pages and a small forum page with a borrowed
                    Oracle book of HTML. Eventually I formally learned a bit of javascript in High School and enjoyed
                    making very simple programs, but ultimately focused more on the sciences.I graduated from Baylor
                    University in 2013 with a degree in Biology focusing on Pre-Medicine, and a minor in Forensic
                    Science.</p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Since then I have worked in two different labs for two
                    different biotechnology companies located in Texas. I excelled at learning new laboratory
                    techniques and using different machines and software to process data from testing of biological
                    products. I had the oportunity to volunteer to be a part of a small group at my current company,
                    tasked with digitizing the location with helpful and needed technological tools.</p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">While working as a scientist I attended and graduated 
                    from the University of Texas's 6 month long Full Stack Web Development coding bootcamp. From 
                    here I found a greater passion for coding and building usable and
                    responsive websites and programs.I was able to utilize my new skills to create
                    Electronic Batch Records to collect information from lab personel during the build process of a
                    product and storing this data in a local database. Together with a few other coworkers, we have
                    also been working on creating a local database for our records, and organizing a company sponsored
                    hackathon at our site location. </p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">A short time after Covid-19 started to affect the US I transitioned 
                    to my new company F1 Payments as a Frontend Software Engineer full time. As one of three Frontend 
                    developers I was tasked with helping to create new features for our customer facing site that allowed
                    merchants to manage their business transactions all on one platform. In addition, I was involved in 
                    creating an internal CRM for our company to be utilized by most every department (HR, IT, Compliance, 
                    Sales, Finance, Operations, etc.) and integrating our partnering banks and processors into our software 
                    for ease of use within our company. While working for F1 I was able to learn about design, and had the 
                    opportunity to design a few features implemented within our CRM. I also had experience being on call 
                    for a week at a time to respond to AWS alerts from our production site and actively troubleshoot, and 
                    sometimes create the solution if it was a frontend issue.</p>
