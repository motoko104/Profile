                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3 col s12">I'm a Full Stack Web Developer who strives to
                    build dynamic apps and websites with my natural talent for organization and love of utilizing
                    creative ideas. <img class="profImg" src="style/images/amanda.jpg" /> I love to organize projects
                    step by step, implementing tests and guidelines to avoid errors or minimize debugging issues, and
                    following through to completion with collaborative ideas. I am experienced
                    working collaboratively with several different teams simultaneously from my previous work
                    experience, and investigating and innovating solutions through the usage and implementation of
                    familiar and new technologies.</p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3 col s12">I'm a creative with several different medias, a
                    TV/Movie afficianatto, and a video game player with a love for animals. I enjoy trying
                    new foods and traveling with friends when im not learning a new technology or craft to make
                    something new.</p>

                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">At a young age I had a great affinity for computers and video games, which evolved into building basic guild pages and a small forum page with a borrowed Oracle book of HTML. Eventually I formally learned a bit of javascript in High School and enjoyed making very simple programs, but ultimately focused more on the sciences.I graduated from Baylor University in 2013 with a degree in Biology focusing on Pre-Medicine, and a minor in Forensic Science.</p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">Since then I have worked in two different labs for two different biotechnology companies located in Texas. I excelled at learning new laboratory techniques and using different machines and software to process data from testing of biological products. I had the oportunity to volunteer to be a part of a small group at my current company, tasked with digitizing the location with helpful and needed technological tools.</p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3 lighten-3">While working with my current employer digitizing the site, I attended and graduated from the University of Texas's 6 month long Full Stack Web Development coding bootcamp. From here I found a greater passion for coding and building usable and responsive websites and programs. Currently my newly aquired skills are being utilized to create Electronic Batch Records to collect information from lab personel during the build process of a product and storing this data in a local database. Together with a few other coworkers, we have also been working on creating a local database for our records, and organizing a company sponsored hackathon at our site location. </p>
                <p class="grey-text text-darken-3">Outside of work I'm currently working on small projects for a small business in Houston, as well as continuing to work on an app created with 2 of my former class mates. I continue to practice and apply new languages and technologies into my own personal projects as well as attending hackathons and meetups to learn from others and collaborate.</p>
